# Grandeur The NFT Membership Marketplace

## Inspiration
When we observed that physical businesses were providing membership cards to attract pre-revenue and attention, they encountered setbacks due to limited traceability and monitoring.

## What it does
We have developed a platform that enables both physical and digital companies to create their own membership NFTs. Users can purchase these NFTs and utilize them through our platform. We also offer an interactive dashboard for companies to track the progress of their NFT memberships.

## How we built it
We utilized Chainlink Functions technology to create dynamic and functional NFTs. When a person receives a membership service, their NFT's state changes through mutual confirmation between the company and the user. All data is securely stored in a decentralized database called Space and Time. Additionally, we integrated a stable currency feature using Chainlink PriceFeed, as physical companies often prefer stable currencies.

## Challenges we encountered
During the implementation of Chainlink Functions, we faced challenges such as gas limit restrictions, callback response size, and computational limitations. Similarly, while working with Space and Time, we had to overcome the limitation of user access token duration, which was set to just 30 minutes. We put in a lot of effort to overcome these challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take great pride in developing a platform with significant use cases that encourage big brands to adopt blockchain technology.

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we acquired knowledge on how to effectively utilize Chainlink Functions, Space and Time, and other essential technologies required to build a DApp.

## What's next for Grandeur
Our future plans for Grandeur include integrating **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** into our platform. This will allow us to make informed decisions about which company's NFTs should be listed on our platform. Verification is crucial to prevent scams resulting from anyone creating membership cards without any scrutiny. Additionally, we intend to incorporate a business-to-business model where companies can utilize our APIs to automate the process of providing yearly gifts to their employees in the form of **brands**memberships.
